	These are developer-facing settings for BubbleChat that can be configured
	through the SetBubbleChatSettings API.

	Every value in this table is the default, which can be overriden by
	developers at runtime.

	Usage:

	        MaxBubbles = 5,
	    })

	-- This is a table where the keys are user IDs and the values are settings tables.
	-- For a given user ID, the associated settings table will override the settings defined above.
	-- Example: UserSpecificSettings = {[12345] = {BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)}}
	-- This will make only the player with user ID 12345 have his bubbles with a red background.
	-- For NPCs (parts that "talk" using the Chat:Chat(part, message) function), use the full name of the part
	-- that you passed as the first argument to Chat:Chat instead of the user ID. Example:
	-- UserSpecificSettings = {[workspace.NPC.Head:GetFullName()] = {BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)}}
	UserSpecificSettings = {}
