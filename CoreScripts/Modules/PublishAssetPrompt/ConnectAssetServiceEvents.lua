--[[
	Adds a Lua listener to external c++ AssetService.h events,
	so that we can open a lua prompt when we receive a game-engine signal.
	This file is not a Roact component because we need to ensure that AssetService events are connected immediately
	on startup. This prevents a potential bug where prompts would not open if triggered early.
	More info here: https://jira.rbx.com/browse/AVBURST-10955
